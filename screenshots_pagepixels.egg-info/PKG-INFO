Learn more about how to configure multi-step actions for your screenshots here: 

https://pagepixels.com/app/documentation#multi-step-screenshots

The following actions are available for use with the multi-step functionality:

| Action                   | Example                                                            |
| ------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Click                    | {"type": "click", "selector": "#your-selector"}                    |
| Hover                    | {"type": "hover", "selector": "#your-selector"}                    |
| Change Notification      | {"type": "change", "selector": "#your-selector", "send_to": "webhook", "url": "https://example.com/webhook-url"} |
| Goto URL                 | {"type": "redirect", "value": "https://example.com"}               |
| Run Javascript           | {"type": "javascript", "value": "console.log('my javascript');"}    |
| Insert CSS               | {"type": "css", "value": "#selector{ color: red }"}                 |
| Text Field Input         | {"type": "text_field", "selector": "#the-text-field", "value": "your-value"} |
| Dropdown Field Selection | {"type": "select", "selector": "#the-dropdown-field", "value": "selected value"} |
| Checkbox Field Input     | {"type": "checkbox", "selector": "#the-checkbox-field", "value": true} |
| Press Enter              | (to submit hidden forms) {"type": "submit"}                         |
| Wait X milliseconds      | {"type": "wait", "value": "5000"}                                   |
| Wait for Selector        | {"type": "wait_for_selector", "selector": "#your-selector"}         |

To use these actions with the Python client, simply provide them as a list of dictionaries in the `options` parameter when creating or updating a screenshot configuration. For example:

```python

client = ScreenshotsPagepixels('your-api-key')
options = {
    "url": "https://www.example.com",
    "multi_step_actions": [
        {"type": "click", "selector": "#your-selector"},
        {"type": "wait", "value": "5000"}
    ]
}
client.create_screenshot_config(options)
```
